# School of the Ancients VR

**Ancient wisdom. Modern minds. One classroom.**

School of the Ancients VR is an immersive educational platform that combines AI, VR, and game mechanics to create dynamic classrooms led by history’s greatest figures.

## Vision
To make learning as engaging as a game, as immersive as VR, and as personalized as a conversation with a mentor.

## Core Features
- **AI-Emulated Mentors**  
  Interact with figures like Socrates, Ada Lovelace, Einstein, Cleopatra, and Marcus Aurelius. Each speaks and teaches in their authentic style.

- **Socratic Q&A**  
  Instead of passively consuming information, learners engage in guided questioning, debates, and reflective dialogue.

- **Immersive Worlds**  
  Explore the Athenian Agora, Renaissance Florence, or Einstein’s lab. The environment reinforces the lesson.

- **Adaptive Curriculum**  
  Lessons evolve based on user knowledge, performance, and curiosity. Knowledge checks are built into the dialogue.

- **Matrix Operator**  
  A voice-driven AI that spawns assets, worlds, and NPCs on command:  
  _“Operator, load the Roman Forum.”_

## Architecture
1. **Autonomous AI Company** – self-managing AI staff optimize curriculum and engagement.
2. **VR School** – interactive classrooms with NPC mentors and dynamic lessons.
3. **Matrix Operator** – orchestrates real-time environment and NPC loading.

## Example Use Case
- A student enters Florence 1500 and learns perspective drawing from Leonardo da Vinci.  
- Socrates joins in to question the meaning of “truth in art.”  
- Marcus Aurelius concludes with a Stoic reflection on the role of beauty in life.  

## Roadmap
- [ ] Core VR world loader (Matrix Operator)  
- [ ] AI Mentor prompt engine (historical figures)  
- [ ] Socratic dialogue flow with branching questions  
- [ ] Multiplayer classrooms for collaborative debate  
- [ ] Gamification: quests, achievements, unlockable mentors

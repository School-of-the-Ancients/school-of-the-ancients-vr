üìò Project Summary 

School of the Ancients VR is an AI-powered, immersive learning platform where students engage with history‚Äôs greatest thinkers, scientists, and leaders inside a dynamic VR classroom.

The system fuses three layers:

Autonomous AI Company ‚Äì a self-managing AI ‚Äúfaculty‚Äù that designs, adapts, and evaluates the curriculum.

School of the Ancients VR ‚Äì immersive domains where learners meet AI-emulated historical figures who teach in their own voices and styles.

Matrix Operator ‚Äì the orchestration layer that spawns environments, assets, and NPCs on command (‚ÄúOperator, load the Renaissance‚Äù).

Core innovation: Socratic Q&A is woven into the experience, so learning becomes a dialogue, not a download. Instead of reading about Galileo, Cleopatra, or Marcus Aurelius, students debate, experiment, and reflect with them inside living worlds.

# School of the Ancients VR

**Ancient wisdom. Modern minds. One classroom.**

School of the Ancients VR is an immersive educational platform that combines AI, VR, and game mechanics to create dynamic classrooms led by history‚Äôs greatest figures.

## Vision
To make learning as engaging as a game, as immersive as VR, and as personalized as a conversation with a mentor.

## Core Features
- **AI-Emulated Mentors**  
  Interact with figures like Socrates, Ada Lovelace, Einstein, Cleopatra, and Marcus Aurelius. Each speaks and teaches in their authentic style.

- **Socratic Q&A**  
  Instead of passively consuming information, learners engage in guided questioning, debates, and reflective dialogue.

- **Immersive Worlds**  
  Explore the Athenian Agora, Renaissance Florence, or Einstein‚Äôs lab. The environment reinforces the lesson.

- **Adaptive Curriculum**  
  Lessons evolve based on user knowledge, performance, and curiosity. Knowledge checks are built into the dialogue.

- **Matrix Operator**  
  A voice-driven AI that spawns assets, worlds, and NPCs on command:  
  _‚ÄúOperator, load the Roman Forum.‚Äù_

## Architecture
1. **Autonomous AI Company** ‚Äì self-managing AI staff optimize curriculum and engagement.
2. **VR School** ‚Äì interactive classrooms with NPC mentors and dynamic lessons.
3. **Matrix Operator** ‚Äì orchestrates real-time environment and NPC loading.

## Example Use Case
- A student enters Florence 1500 and learns perspective drawing from Leonardo da Vinci.  
- Socrates joins in to question the meaning of ‚Äútruth in art.‚Äù  
- Marcus Aurelius concludes with a Stoic reflection on the role of beauty in life.  

## Roadmap
- [ ] Core VR world loader (Matrix Operator)  
- [ ] AI Mentor prompt engine (historical figures)  
- [ ] Socratic dialogue flow with branching questions  
- [ ] Multiplayer classrooms for collaborative debate  
- [ ] Gamification: quests, achievements, unlockable mentors

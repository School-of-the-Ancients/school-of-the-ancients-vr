# **School of the Ancients — Product Specification**

**Date:** 9/21/25\
**Concept:** Autonomous AI Company + School of the Ancients VR + Matrix Operator

---

## **WHY – VISION & PURPOSE**

**What problem are you solving and for whom?**\
Education today often feels static, text-heavy, and disconnected from lived experience. Students struggle with engagement, retention, and critical thinking when faced with rote memorization and lecture formats. *School of the Ancients* solves this by making learning interactive, personalized, and immersive. It brings history, science, and philosophy to life through AI-driven roleplay, turning learning into a dialogue rather than a download. This is designed for students, lifelong learners, and educators seeking engaging, adaptive teaching tools.

**What does your application do?**\
*School of the Ancients* is a self-managed VR learning environment run by an autonomous AI company. It emulates historical figures, inventors, scientists, and philosophers as teachers, each creating their own character prompts and teaching their fields in-character. Lessons unfold Socratically — through question-and-answer exchanges — with AI adapting content to the learner’s knowledge. The Matrix Operator system loads custom VR worlds (“Load the Renaissance,” “Enter the Roman Agora”) where these AI figures teach interactively.

**Who will use it?**

- **Students** (middle school to university) seeking engaging and personalized ways to learn history, science, and philosophy.

- **Educators** who want AI co-teachers or dynamic VR classrooms.

- **Lifelong learners** curious about exploring knowledge in an immersive, game-like environment.

- **Developers/creators** who want to extend the system by adding new AI teachers or custom domains.

**Why will they use it instead of alternatives?**\
Unlike e-learning platforms (Coursera, Khan Academy), *School of the Ancients* provides:

- **Immersion**: Students *meet* and *debate with* Socrates, Einstein, or Cleopatra in their historical settings.

- **Personalization**: Curriculum adapts dynamically based on learner knowledge and choices.

- **Agency**: Users or AI have sudo privileges in the Matrix Operator, reshaping worlds and lessons on demand.

- **Critical thinking focus**: Socratic Q&A encourages reasoning, not rote answers.

- **Extensibility**: Any historical or influential figure can be added as a VR teacher, expanding endlessly.

## **HOW – PLANNING & IMPLEMENTATION**

**What are the required stack components?**

- **Frontend (VR/AR):** Unity or Unreal Engine; VRIF/XRI for interaction; OpenXR support.

- **Backend:** Node.js / Python APIs; Supabase (data logging, progress tracking); Temporal (workflow orchestration).

- **AI Models:** OpenAI GPT-5 (character emulation + Socratic dialogue); Qdrant/pgvector (memory retrieval for historical accuracy).

- **Matrix Operator:** HTTP/WS runtime server with prefab loaders (Unity Addressables, glTFast).

- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized services (Postgres, Qdrant, Redis); DigitalOcean/AWS hosting.

**What are the system requirements?**

- **Performance:** Low-latency dialogue in VR; target &lt;300ms response time.

- **Scalability:** Multi-user sessions; ability to support classroom groups of 20+.

- **Security:** Role-based access; student data privacy (FERPA/GDPR compliance).

- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime for backend services; session persistence for lesson continuity.

- **Integration:** Must integrate with existing VR assets, voice AI, and educational LMS platforms (Canvas, Moodle).

**What are the key user flows?**

1. **Student Flow:**

   - Entry: User dons headset, chooses subject.

   - Operator loads world + teacher NPC.

   - NPC begins Socratic Q&A based on knowledge level.

   - Student answers, debates, explores.

   - NPC adapts lesson, tracks progress.

   - Exit: Session summary + suggested next steps.

2. **Educator Flow:**

   - Teacher creates class module.

   - Students enter shared VR classroom.

   - Teacher + AI NPC co-facilitate learning.

   - Reports generated for student progress.

**What are the core interfaces?**

- **Matrix Operator Console:** For spawning worlds, teachers, and lessons.

- **VR Learning Environment:** Main student interface; immersive classrooms, debates, experiments.

- **Curriculum Dashboard:** Educator view for progress tracking, adjusting difficulty, reviewing logs.

- **AI Company Backend:** Self-optimization system managing lesson libraries, metrics, and agentic roles.
